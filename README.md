## Project Description
I am going to work on creating a game that contains all of the most popular card games. Card games that will be included are Rummy, Hearts, Blackjack, 1v1 Poker, and Solitaire. Players can choose to play casually or put in game currency down as bets. In order to access each game, the player will navigate their avatar through a simple in-game menu, which will look like the lobby of a casino or arcade. Each of the games will be accessed by walking to a table that has the same name as the card game that they wish to play.
